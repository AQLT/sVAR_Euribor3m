# Introduction {-}

In this essay, we build on a VAR model to quantify the effects of variations in the Euribor-3M (benchmark short term market rate in Europe) rate on a series of key macroeconomic variables (GDP, inflation, unemployment, investment) both at the Euro Area (EA) level, and in the particular case of France. We map out different scenarios of rise and falls in the Euribor-3M to assess the response of the economy to monetary shocks of different kinds and amplitudes. Our model predicts that a one standard-deviation rise in the Euribor-3M rate is associated with a significant and lingering drift of the EA GDP down its no-shock trend. Further, we find evidence that a rise in the short term monetary rate brings conventional inflation below its no-shock trend for a substantial period of time. We also find that a rising Euribor-3M rate has a detrimental effect on both the EA and the French labor markets. PARLER DES SCENARII

When it comes to the relationship between the short-term rate and the main macroeconomic variables, our VAR-based findings are consistent with the theoretical predictions of the Neo-keynesian framework : a tightening of monetary policy has a negative impact on aggregate demand, which deteriorates employment and brings down inflation in a significant fashion. 

In the first part, we present our data set and provide the origin of our empirical resources. We then present our empirical strategy and the features of our specification in the second part. Finally, the last part exhibits the results of our estimations. 

# Data setting {-}

## Data origin and features {-}

ORIGIN

We extensively rely on macroeconomic data provided by official statistical offices... We choose a time frame spanning 1997-2018. Why this time span ? 

GDP : real, SA, EURO2005? à vérifier
FBCE : real, SA
Our data on unemployment originates from the Eurostat Database

FEATURES & STATIONARITY 

Before implementing the VAR model, we make sure that our variables feature stationarity. Why ? We thus detrend consumption, unemployment ... The following KPSS tests provides strong evidence for the stationarity of our macroeconomic variables. 

Graphs

## A few stylized facts {-}
 
In this subsection, we exhibit a few stylized facts characterizing the macroeconomic trends in the EA between 1997 and 2018. Likewise, we give similar facts in the particular case of France. 

ALL GRAPHS BOUND TOGETHER DANS UN FRAME ENTRE 1997 et 2018

Graphs short term rate

Graphs variables of aggregate demand : FBCF, Consumption, GDP 
consistent with the theory, FBCF varies more than consumption?

Graphs unemployment

Graphs price variables

Comment :

Upon careful observation of the above graphs, it is clear that the macroeconomic history of the EA splits out in two periods, respectively spanning 1997-2008, and 2008-2018. The 2008 financial crisis is a watershed marking the start of a period of weaker macroeconomic performance, whether it be for France or the EA as a whole. It is worth noting that the macroeconomic situation is particularly depressed between 2012 and 2015 amid the austerity policies which were implemented in the wake of the sovereign debt crisis. How is France wrt. EA? France performs worse that the EA ! Parler justement de ce qu'on observe entre les taux et les macro variables. A noteworthy observation is that the EA economy fell deeper in the wake of the 2011 policy rate rise, which translated into a rise in the Euribor rate. 

# Empirical strategy {-}

In this section, we describe and explain the features of our VAR specification 

## Presentation of our VAR model {-}

Model specification. And potential identification problems --> necessary to fine tune/adjust the features of the model.  

## Fine tuning of the model {-}

How many lags? Why? Why this matrix of intertwined effects? --> based on the NK model. We choose to compute orthogonalized IRFs. Why?

# Estimations & results {-}

In this section, we depict the results of the our estimation endeavor.

## Empirical takeways in the case of the EA {-}

### Scenario n°1 {-}

A scenario of rise

### Scenario n°2 {-}

A scenario of fall

## Empirical takeways in the case of France {-}

### Scenario n°1 {-}
### Scenario n°2 {-}

Upon careful examnitation of the above IRFs, we notice that a rise in the Euribor has a significant effect on GDP ... A one SS rise in the Euribor is associated with ... long drift of GDP below its no shock trend. What's more, a similar rise in the Euribor goes along a significant rise in the unemployment rate... 

The above observations provide evidence that our findings are consistent with some key theoretical predictions of the Neo Keynesian model: 
 
A rise in the interest rate causes :

- A drop in output
- A rise in unemployment
- A fall in the rate of inflation
